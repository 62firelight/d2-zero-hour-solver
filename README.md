# Destiny 2 Zero Hour Solver

D2 Zero Hour Solver is a web application that is intended to solve the Zero Hour configuration puzzle in Destiny 2. This app was mainly built for me to practice using React, as the puzzle is currently not available in-game. 

Heavily inspired by a similar app from pastuleo23 (AKA [Cheese Forever on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cheeseforever)) formerly available at this [link](https://fiddle.jshell.net/pastuleo23/xu1snrc0/show) and another similar app from DeedleFake available [here](https://deedlefake.github.io/zero-hour-configuration-solver/). 

## Usage

Access the app here: https://d2-zero-hour-solver.pages.dev/

Alternatively, you can clone the repo, run `npm install` inside the cloned repo to install dependencies and then `npm start` to start the development server at http://localhost:3000/.
