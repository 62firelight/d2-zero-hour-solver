# Destiny 2 Zero Hour Solver

D2 Zero Hour Solver is a web application that was originally intended to solve the Zero Hour configuration puzzle in Destiny 2. This app was mainly built for me to practice using React, as the puzzle is currently not available in-game. 

D2 Zero Hour Solver is now a compilation of helpful resources for the new version of Zero Hour introduced with Into the Light.

Heavily inspired by a similar app from pastuleo23 (AKA [Cheese Forever on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cheeseforever)) formerly available at this [link](https://fiddle.jshell.net/pastuleo23/xu1snrc0/show) and another similar app from DeedleFake available [here](https://deedlefake.github.io/zero-hour-configuration-solver/). 

## Usage

Access the app here: https://d2-zero-hour-solver.pages.dev/

Alternatively, you can clone the repo, run `npm install` inside the cloned repo to install dependencies and then `npm start` to start the development server at http://localhost:3000/.

## Developer Usage

Intended for contributors (which will probably be me in at least 1 year for now).

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/62firelight/d2-zero-hour-solver.git`
2. Inside the newly cloned repo folder (named `d2-zero-hour-solver`), run `npm install` to download all of the project's dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
